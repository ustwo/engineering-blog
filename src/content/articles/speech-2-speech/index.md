Just like we go to the supermarket to select ingredients for a recipe, we can also choose digital "ingredients" to build solutions. In this article, I’d like to explore the complexity of these applications.

How easy is it to create a "Speech-to-Speech" solution that captures speech, processes it, and translates it into another language in real-time?

It’s surprisingly accessible to quickly create such a solution using AI services. OpenAI for natural language processing, AssemblyAI for speech recognition, and ElevenLabs for speech synthesis have been game-changers.

In simple terms, here’s what each tool does:

- **OpenAI:** Translates text between different languages.
- **AssemblyAI:** Converts spoken words into written text (transcription).
- **ElevenLabs:** Turns written text back into natural-sounding speech (speech synthesis).
