      <h1>About ustwo engineering</h1>
      <p>Hey! We're the engineering bit of ustwo, working on building breakthrough experiences for our clients - normally in the form of building digital products. We love a bit of cross-functionality, but we tend to focus on full-stack web, native iOS and Android, some cross-platform mobile (such as React Native or Kotlin Multiplatform), and QA/test.</p>
      <p>Given ustwo's legacy as a product and design-led company, we tend to skew towards the more "creative technologist" end of technologists, but we do put a lot of emphasis on careful craft. We stay up at night thinking about accessibility, build pipelines, and architecture diagrams - just as much as we love well-designed products that make peoples' lives better.</p>
      <p>We hope this blog serves to open a window into the things we're thinking about - in projects, at home, or as we think about how we work together as a group. We'd love to <a href="/contact">chat</a> if you're up for it!</p>
      <h2>Our engineering vision</h2>
      <p>We are a diverse team of innovative, curious, product-minded techies, driven to create meaningful, accessible, high-quality products that improve lives. United by collaboration and a passion for user-centred design, we're continuously learning, inspiring positive change, and finding the joy in our work and interactions.</p>
      <h2>About ustwo</h2>
