If you are a new developer, we have a script you can run to install all dependencies, there
may be parts that you do-not wish to install, so pick and choose what you need when asked.

```
sh ./scripts/new-developer.sh
```

## GitHub Pages with Jekyll <a name="jekyll"></a>

Install [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/macos/)

```bash
gem install jekyll
```

If you're on a Mac, you may want to use [RBENV](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv) to install `Ruby` versions

```bash
rbenv install 3.1.3
```

Then switch to that version, either local or global:

```bash
rbenv local 3.1.3
rbenv global 3.1.3
```
